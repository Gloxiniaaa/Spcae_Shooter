# Space Shooter - My First C++ Game

Welcome to **Space Shooter**, my first ever game written in C++! This is a simple 2D space shooter where you control a spaceship, shoot bullets, and destroy enemy ships. This project was created as a learning experience.

## How to Play

- **Move Left/Right**: Use the Left and Right arrow keys to move your spaceship.
- **Shoot**: Press the Spacebar to fire bullets at enemies.
- **Objective**: Destroy enemy ships that spawn from the top of the screen before they reach the bottom.
- **Quit**: Close the window or press the window's close button to exit.

## Libraries Used

This game is built using the following libraries:
- **SDL3 (Simple DirectMedia Layer)**: Version 3.2.8 - A cross-platform development library for handling graphics, input, and window management. SDL3 powers the core rendering and event handling in Space Shooter.
- **SDL3_image**: Version 3.2.4 - An extension to SDL3 that enables loading of image files (like PNGs) as textures. Used for loading the player, bullet, and enemy sprites.

## Development Environment

- **Compiler**: MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) - I used this to compile the C++ code on Windows.
- **Build System**: Makefile
